B = 106,500
C = 123,500
STEP = 17
h = 0

for b in range(B, C, STEP):
    f = 1
    d = 2

    for d in range(2, b + 1):
        for e in range(2, b + 1):
            if d*e == b:
                f = 0

    if f == 0:
        h += 1


How many of the numbers 106,500, 106,517, 106,534, ..., 123,500 are not prime?
